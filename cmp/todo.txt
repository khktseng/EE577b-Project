TODO:
 - Clock gate multiplier
 - Integrate divider into alu_clk
 - Create and integrate sequential DW square root
 - Determine optimal number of clocks for sequential DW elements
 - Clock/power gate unused single cycle alu operations (bitwise, shifter?, rotator?)
 - Critical path timing for each pipeline stage
 - verify WaW and WaR hazard handling
 - fix branching

DONE:
 - Integrate rotator into alu_clk
 - Integrate shifter into alu_clk
 - Fix WaW and Fwding hazards in pipeline
 - Verify shifter.v, rotator.v meet timing
